MindScape

Description

MindScape is an immersive art project that beautifully marries the science of Artificial Intelligence with personal memories. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and Microsoft Kinect technology, we have transformed photographs into a unique, interactive 3D visual experience.

This repository houses all the necessary coding files related to this project.
